you might wonder well it&rsquo;s not a hard thing but believe me when I say it.
It&rsquo;s too damn HARD! But anyway, let me tell the story.</p>
<p>One day an Indian guy found my profile in <a href="https://rive.app/a/SamadiPour/">Rive</a>.
He wanted an animation for his flutter application. So we talked about it and I prepared everything. 
The job was easy, and he liked it very much. after two or three weeks, he came to me with a new project.</p>
<p>Basally it was a simple task management application that admin could create tasks for employees.
The app is connected to API and Firebase services. Some of the app&rsquo;s necessary features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending and Receiving task attachment</li>
<li>Comment about the task from employee</li>
<li>Task timeline for every day</li>
<li>User report statistics</li>
<li>Push notification (with Firebase Cloud Messaging)</li>
</ul>
<p>I started the project on Jun 24 and finished it on Jun 30. although the project had 7-10 days time, I needed to focus on
university exams, and I needed to finish it fast. So I spent a lot more than usual working on it. I also have
a time tracker in Android Studio which tells me that I spent 47 hours coding for this project.</p>
<p>Here is a demo of the app. I hope you enjoy it.</p>
